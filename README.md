This is a MATLAB coded package facilitating automized image processing for various applications.


Description:
Detecting synapses via fluorescence labeling is challenging due to variations in shape, size, and intensity. Most labs use manual or semi-manual methods, which are time-consuming and error-prone. We developed SynEdgeWs, a MATLAB-based algorithm that uses edge filters, morphological operators, and marker-controlled watershed segmentation. It requires no training data and minimal user intervention, outperforming threshold-based methods. SynEdgeWs includes two routines: SynEval for three-channel image analysis and ImgSegRout for image stacks. We tested ImgSegRout on live-cell imaging data and used SynEval to compare synaptic vesicle recycling in cortical cultures.
