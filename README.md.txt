Log_2021_11_22: SynEval beta version out; .exe can now be downloaded

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are routines for visualization and quantification of synaptic puncta for common experimental settings

All functions are programmed in MATLAB R2017b

We are updating GUI with following settings

for SynEval:
Camerasettings, max/min size of expected puncta in µm, binning, magnifications --> calculation of expected size range in pixels
number of iterations

for ImgSegRout:
Camerasettings, max/min size of expected puncta in µm, binning, magnifications --> calculation of expected size range in pixels
number of iterations
discard bright regions yes/no
denoise during preprocessing yes/no

 

this function is not being updated anymore;
